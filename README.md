•	Conducted extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Covid-19 data from various countries and regions.

•	Utilized Prophet model to forecast Covid-19 cases for the next 30 days by applying time series forecasting techniques such as trend analysis, seasonality decomposition, and anomaly detection.

•	Visualized the results of the EDA and time series forecasting using various plotting techniques such as line plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps to gain deeper insights into the data and effectively communicate the findings to stakeholders.

Covid-19 Cases Prediction with Machine Learning

Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented situation worldwide. The pandemic has affected millions of people and
caused numerous fatalities. Time series forecasting can be a useful tool to predict the future trend of COVID-19 cases, which can assist in
planning and making effective decisions. In this project, we will use Python to perform time series forecasting for COVID-19 cases.

Dataset: The dataset used in this project will be sourced from an open data repository or a reliable source such as John Hopkins University
Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). The dataset will include the daily number of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries,
as well as other relevant information, such as location and date.

Methodology: The project will follow the following steps:

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing - The data will be preprocessed to ensure that it is in a usable format. This includes removing any
missing values, filtering relevant data, and transforming the data if needed.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Exploring the data by visualizing and understanding the patterns, trends, and relationships between
different variables in the data.

3. Time Series Forecasting - We will use different models for time series forecasting such as ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM. The

models will be trained on a subset of the data and validated on another subset of the data to evaluate their performance. The best

performing model will be selected for making future predictions.

4. Prediction and Visualization - The selected model will be used to make future predictions for COVID-19 cases. The predicted values will
be plotted alongside the actual values to visualize the trend and compare the accuracy of the model.


Tools: Python will be the primary programming language used for this project. We will use several Python libraries such as Pandas for data
manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and Scikit-learn for model selection and evaluation. Additionally, we may also use
specialized libraries such as statsmodels, foprophet, and Tensorflow/Keras for time series forecasting.

Conclusion: The project will provide a valuable resource for predicting the future trend of COVID-19 cases using time series forecasting

techniques. It will be useful for public health officials, policymakers, and researchers to make informed decisions and plan accordingly. The
project will also serve as a basis for future research in the field of time series forecasting for epidemiological data.
